> **SmartShift** is an intelligent scheduling and wellness management platform tailored for the healthcare, hospitality, and dynamic shift sectors across the MENA region.
>
> **Problem:** Irregular shift work causes employee burnout, fatigue, and high turnover. Managers lack tools to proactively identify at-risk staff, leading to decreased service quality and increased operational costs.
>
> **Solution:** An AI-powered scheduling system that balances operational needs with employee well-being through:
>
> - **Automated scheduling** with burnout prevention rules.
> - **Real-time fatigue scoring** (0-100 scale with risk levels).
> - **RAG-powered wellness journal** with natural language AI parsing.
> - **Intelligent shift swap validation** using decision-tree logic.
> - **Predictive analytics** for burnout trends and staffing insights.

> 
> #### 🧠 RAG-Powered Wellness Journal
> High-fidelity analysis of employee journals using GPT-4 and Qdrant vector storage. Enables semantic search, allowing managers to query concerns naturally and identify recurring wellness patterns.
> 
> #### 📅 Intelligent Auto-Scheduler
> Advanced algorithmic generation of weekly schedules that balances operational coverage, availability, and fatigue risks. Managers can review real-time metrics to approve, reject, or fine-tune assignments.
> 

> #### 📉 Real-Time Burnout Prediction
> A holistic fatigue scoring system (Quantitative, Qualitative, Psychological) that updates dynamically. It proactively flags critical cases and prevents high-risk scheduling before exhaustion occurs.
