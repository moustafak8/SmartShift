> **SmartShift** is an intelligent scheduling and wellness management platform tailored for the healthcare, hospitality, and dynamic shift sectors across the MENA region.
>
> **Problem:** Irregular shift work causes employee burnout, fatigue, and high turnover. Managers lack tools to proactively identify at-risk staff, leading to decreased service quality and increased operational costs.
>
> **Solution:** An AI-powered scheduling system that balances operational needs with employee well-being through:
> - **Automated scheduling** with burnout prevention rules.
> - **Real-time fatigue scoring** (0-100 scale with risk levels).
> - **RAG-powered wellness journal** with natural language AI parsing.
> - **Intelligent shift swap validation** using decision-tree logic.
> - **Predictive analytics** for burnout trends and staffing insights.
